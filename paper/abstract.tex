We present several potential hydrodynamics schemes for the next suite
of \eagle{} simulations. The \anarchy{} scheme used in the original \eagle{}
code is first shown to not be suitable due to its inability to handle
energy injection without significant computational cost. We then move
on to consider the viable alternatives; a Pressure-Energy based scheme
with the \anarchy{} physics, and a Density-Energy based scheme with the
\anarchy{} physics. The Pressure-Energy scheme has exhibited problems
with time integration in the \swift{} \eagle{} implementation (not described
here yet), hence the search for another viable scheme. We show that the
Density-Energy \anarchy{}-DU provides excellent solutions to a suite of
hydrodynamics test problems.
