\section{Introduction}
\blue{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Background on SPH, Monaghan 1977 -> Hernquist 1999 -> Schaye 2015
    \item Background on more complex hydro models and other ways of doing things,
          Teyssier 2001 -> Springel 2011 -> Hopkins 2015. Note that this makes
          sub-grid physics harder. Mention stability of SPH
    \item Developments on SPH side of things, Agertz 2007 -> Price 2008 -> 
          Hopkins 2013 -> Hu 2015 -> Dalla Vecchia in prep.
    \item Mention that these more complex models may not actually result in
          improved performance, and that it is important to consider their
          effects including sub-grid physics as this is how they will eventually
          be ran.
