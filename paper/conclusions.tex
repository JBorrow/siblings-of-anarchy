\section{Conclusions}

We have presented two `siblings' to the original EAGLE/\anarchy{} 
SPH scheme in \anarchy{}-DU and \anarchy{}-PU. These schemes solve the
energy injection issue described in \S \ref{sec:energyinjection}
and provide similar performance on a typical hydrodynamics test suite.

The \anarchy{}-DU scheme was initially conceived to solve conceptual issues
identified in Pressure-Energy with time integration, but has now been
shown to perform better than Pressure-Energy based schemes on a suite of
hydrodynamics tests due to its increased levels of energy diffusion
providing improved solutions to a hydrostatic halo problem and the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

        \item Analytical/numerical 1D calculation to see if we can diffuse 
              energy into the cores of galaxies over time
