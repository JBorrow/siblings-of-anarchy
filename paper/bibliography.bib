  abstract = {We investigate the formation of galactic halos in a flat universe dominated by cold dark matter. The amplitude and scale of the initial fluctuations are set to agree with previous models for the large-scale galaxy distribution. We use gravitational AT-body simulations to study cubic regions of present size \textasciitilde{}14 Mpc and of varying density. We follow such regions from z = 6 to the present with a linear resolution which decreases from \textasciitilde{}2 to \textasciitilde{}14 kpc. Halos of galactic scale form abundantly in these models only after z \textasciitilde{} 3. Their early evolution is dominated by mergers, but the merger rate begins to decline after z \textasciitilde{} 1. Although recent mergers are responsible for the most massive of present-day halos, many smaller systems grew in a relatively quiescent fashion after z \textasciitilde{} 0.5. Throughout the central regions of most dark halos the circular velocity is almost independent of radius, predicting a ``rotation curve'' similar in form to those of spiral galaxies. However, the circular velocities of the most massive systems rise significantly between 50 and 100 kpc. We conjecture that these objects correspond to the massive halos of elliptical galaxies or to the merged halos of small groups. The bulk rotation velocity of halos is typically only about 10\% of their velocity dispersion and is roughly independent of radius. Many halos are strongly aspherical with three unequal axes. There is, perhaps, a slight preference for near-prolate shapes. The mass distribution of the halo population is well approximated by a power law of index \textemdash{} 2 with a high mass cutoff which grows rapidly with time, especially in high-density regions. If we identify the cumulative mass distribution of dark halos with the cumulative luminosity distribution of galaxies, we are able to reproduce both the form and the amplitude of the Tully-Fisher/Faber-Jackson relation. This match between the predicted abundance of halos and the observed abundance of galaxies is a major success of the model. Massive halos form preferentially in regions of high dark matter density and are thus naturally biased relative to the mass. Their formation sites correspond well to high peaks of the initial linear density field. This bias may be as strong as is required to reconcile a flat universe with the dynamics of observed galaxy systems, but further work is needed to demonstrate this point conclusively. Our models set the stage for galaxy formation in the cold dark matter cosmogony; they suggest explanations for the different morphological types of galaxies, for their differing distributions, and for indications of substantial evolution in galaxy properties at moderate redshift.},

  abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 1997), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density {$\Lambda$}CDM universe are reported, with 2563 particles and 4.1 \texttimes{} 107 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 81923. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

  abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.},

  abstract = {When averaged over large scales, star formation in galaxies is observed to follow the empirical Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law for surface densities above a constant threshold. While the observed law involves surface densities, theoretical models and simulations generally work with volume density laws (i.e. Schmidt laws). We derive analytic relations between star formation laws expressed in terms of surface densities, volume densities, and pressures and we show how these relations depend on parameters such as the effective equation of state of the multiphase interstellar medium. Our analytic relations enable us to implement observed surface density laws into simulations. Because the parameters of our prescription for star formation are observables, we are not free to tune them to match the observations. We test our theoretical framework using high-resolution simulations of isolated disc galaxies that assume an effective equation of state for the multiphase interstellar medium. We are able to reproduce the star formation threshold and both the slope and the normalisation of arbitrary input KS laws without tuning any parameters and with very little scatter, even for unstable galaxies and even if we use poor numerical resolution. Moreover, we can do so for arbitrary effective equations of state. Our prescription therefore enables simulations of galaxies to bypass our current inability to simulate the formation of stars. On the other hand, the fact that we can reproduce arbitrary input thresholds and KS laws, rather than just the particular ones picked out by nature, indicates that simulations that lack the physics and/or resolution to simulate the multiphase interstellar medium can only provide limited insight into the origin of the observed star formation laws.},

The entropy profiles are robustly measured at least out to R1000 in all systems and out to R500 in thirteen systems. Compared to theoretical expectations from non-radiative cosmological simulations, the observed distributions show a radial and mass-dependent excess entropy, such that the excess is greater and extends to larger radii in lower mass systems. At R500, the mass dependence and entropy excess are both negligible within the large observational and theoretical uncertainties. Mirroring this behaviour, the scaling of gas entropy is shallower than self-similar in the inner regions, but steepens with radius, becoming consistent with self-similar at R500. There is a large dispersion in scaled entropy in the inner regions, apparently linked to the presence of cool cores and dynamical activity; at larger radii the dispersion decreases by approximately a factor of two to 30 per cent, and the dichotomy between subsamples disappears. There are two peaks in the distribution of both inner slope and, after parameterising the profiles with a power law plus constant model, in central entropy K0. However, we are unable to distinguish between a bimodal or a left-skewed distribution of K0 with the present data. The distribution of outer slopes is unimodal with a median value of 0.98, and there is a clear correlation of outer slope with temperature.

  issn = {00358711, 13652966},
  shorttitle = {{\emph{E Pur Si Muove}}},
  abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code AREPO, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.},

  volume = {428},
  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {Various formulations of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) have been proposed, intended to resolve certain difficulties in the treatment of fluid mixing instabilities. Most have involved changes to the algorithm which either introduces artificial correction terms or violates what is arguably the greatest advantage of SPH over other methods: manifest conservation of energy, entropy, momentum and angular momentum. Here, we show how a class of alternative SPH equations of motion (EOM) can be derived self-consistently from a discrete particle Lagrangian \textendash{} guaranteeing manifest conservation \textendash{} in a manner which tremendously improves treatment of these instabilities and contact discontinuities. Saitoh \& Makino recently noted that the volume element used to discretize the EOM does not need to explicitly invoke the mass density (as in the `standard' approach); we show how this insight, and the resulting degree of freedom, can be incorporated into the rigorous Lagrangian formulation that retains ideal conservation properties and includes the `{$\nabla$}h' terms that account for variable smoothing lengths. We derive a general EOM for any choice of volume element (particle `weights') and method of determining smoothing lengths. We then specify this to a `pressure\textendash{}entropy formulation' which resolves problems in the traditional treatment of fluid interfaces. Implementing this in a new version of the GADGET code, we show it leads to good performance in mixing experiments (e.g. Kelvin\textendash{}Helmholtz and `blob' tests). And conservation is maintained even in strong shock/blastwave tests, where formulations without manifest conservation produce large errors. This also improves the treatment of subsonic turbulence and lessens the need for large kernel particle numbers. The code changes are trivial and entail no additional numerical expense. This provides a general framework for self-consistent derivation of different `flavours' of SPH.},

Starting from the public version of Gadget-2, we included the complex treatment of the baryon physics: gas cooling, star formation law, chemical evolution, and supernova feedback. We qualified the performances of GEAR in the case of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) galaxies. Our code GEAR conserves the total energy budget of the systems to better than 5\% over 14 Gyr and provides an excellent convergence of the results with numerical resolution. We showed that models of dSphs in a static Euclidean space, where the expansion of the universe is neglected are valid. In addition, we tackled some existing open questions in the field, such as the stellar mass fraction of dSphs and its link to the predicted dark matter halo mass function, the effect of supernova feedback, the spatial distribution of the stellar populations, and the origin of the diversity in star formation histories and chemical abundance patterns. Strong supernova-driven winds seem incompatible with the observed metallicities and luminosities. Despite newly formed stars being preferentially found in the galaxy central parts, turbulent motions in the gas can quickly erase any metallicity gradient. The diversity in properties of dSph are related to a range of total masses, as well as a range of dispersion in the central densities, which is also seen in the halos emerging from a {$\Lambda$}CDM cosmogony.},

  abstract = {We investigate the means by which cold gas can accrete on to Milky Way mass galaxies from a hot corona of gas, using a new smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, `SPHS'. We find that the `cold clumps' seen in many classic SPH simulations in the literature are not present in our SPHS simulations. Instead, cold gas condenses from the halo along filaments that form at the intersection of supernovae-driven bubbles from previous phases of star formation. This positive feedback feeds cold gas to the galactic disc directly, fuelling further star formation. The resulting galaxies in the SPH and SPHS simulations differ greatly in their morphology, gas phase diagrams and stellar content. We show that the classic SPH cold clumps owe to a numerical thermal instability caused by an inability for cold gas to mix in the hot halo. The improved treatment of mixing in SPHS suppresses this instability leading to a dramatically different physical outcome. In our highest resolution SPHS simulation, we find that the cold filaments break up into bound, physically motivated clumps that form stars. The filaments are overdense by a factor of 10\textendash{}100 compared to the surrounding gas, suggesting that the fragmentation results from a physical non-linear instability driven by the overdensity. This `fragmenting filament' mode of disc growth has important implications for galaxy formation, in particular the role of star formation in bringing cold gas into disc galaxies.},

  abstract = {The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is a useful numerical tool to study a variety of astrophysical and planetlogical problems. However, it turned out that the standard SPH algorithm has problems in dealing with hydrodynamical instabilities. This problem is due to the assumption that the local density distribution is differentiable. In order to solve this problem, a new SPH formulation, which does not require the differentiability of the density, was proposed. This new SPH method improved the treatment of hydrodynamical instabilities. This method, however, is applicable only to the equation of state (EOS) of an ideal gas. In this paper, we describe how to extend the new SPH method to non-ideal EOS. We present the results of various standard numerical tests for non-ideal EOS. Our new method works well for non-ideal EOS. We conclude that our new SPH can handle hydrodynamical instabilities for an arbitrary EOS, and that it is an attractive alternative to the standard SPH.},

  abstract = {The standard formulation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) assumes that the local density distribution is differentiable. This assumption is used to derive the spatial derivatives of other quantities. However, this assumption breaks down at the contact discontinuity. At the contact discontinuity, the density of the low-density side is overestimated while that of the high-density side is underestimated. As a result, the pressure of the low-density (high-density) side is overestimated (underestimated). Thus, unphysical repulsive force appears at the contact discontinuity, resulting in the effective surface tension. This tension suppresses fluid instabilities. In this paper, we present a new formulation of SPH, which does not require the differentiability of density. Instead of the mass density, we adopt the internal energy density (pressure) and its arbitrary function, which are smoothed quantities at the contact discontinuity, as the volume element used for the kernel integration. We call this new formulation density-independent SPH (DISPH). It handles the contact discontinuity without numerical problems. The results of standard tests such as the shock tube, Kelvin\textendash{}Helmholtz and Rayleigh\textendash{}Taylor instabilities, point-like explosion, and blob tests are all very favorable to DISPH. We conclude that DISPH solved most of the known difficulties of the standard SPH, without introducing additional numerical diffusion or breaking the exact force symmetry or energy conservation. Our new SPH includes the formulation proposed by Ritchie \& Thomas as a special case. Our formulation can be extended to handle a non-ideal gas easily.},

  abstract = {The approximate computation of all gravitational forces between N interacting particles via the fast multipole method (FMM) can be made as accurate as direct summation, but requires less than O(N) operations. FMM groups particles into spatially bounded cells and uses cell-cell interactions to approximate the force at any position within the sink cell by a Taylor expansion obtained from the multipole expansion of the source cell. By employing a novel estimate for the errors incurred in this process, I minimise the computational effort required for a given accuracy and obtain a well-behaved distribution of force errors. For relative force errors of {$\sim$} 10\textendash{}7, the computational costs exhibit an empirical scaling of {$\propto$} N0.87. My implementation (running on a 16 core node) out-performs a GPU-based direct summation with comparable force errors for N 105.},

This includes a pressure\textendash{}entropy formulation with a Wendland kernel, a higher order estimate of velocity gradients, a modified artificial viscosity switch with a modified strong limiter, and artificial conduction of thermal energy. With a series of idealized hydrodynamic tests, we show that the pressure\textendash{}entropy formulation is ideal for resolving fluid mixing at contact discontinuities but performs conspicuously worse at strong shocks due to the large entropy discontinuities. Including artificial conduction at shocks greatly improves the results. In simulations of Milky Way like disc galaxies a feedback-induced instability develops if too much artificial viscosity is introduced. Our modified artificial viscosity scheme prevents this instability and shows efficient shock capturing capability. We also investigate the star formation rate and the galactic outflow. The star formation rates vary slightly for different SPH schemes while the mass loading is sensitive to the SPH scheme and significantly reduced in our favoured implementation. We compare the accretion behaviour of the hot halo gas. The formation of cold blobs, an artefact of simple SPH implementations, can be eliminated efficiently with proper fluid mixing, either by conduction and/or by using a pressure\textendash{}entropy formulation.},

We find that the properties of most galaxies, including their masses and sizes, are not significantly affected by the details of the hydrodynamics solver. However, the star formation rates of the most massive objects are affected by the lack of phase mixing due to spurious surface tension in the simulation using standard SPH. This affects the efficiency with which AGN activity can quench star formation in these galaxies and it also leads to differences in the intragroup medium that affect the X-ray emission from these objects. The differences that can be attributed to the hydrodynamics solver are, however, likely to be less important at lower resolution. We also find that the use of a time-step limiter is important for achieving the feedback efficiency required to match observations of the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.},

  abstract = {We investigate constraints on cosmic reionization extracted from the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We combine the Planck CMB anisotropy data in temperature with the low-multipole polarization data to fit {$\Lambda$}CDM models with various parameterizations of the reionization history. We obtain a Thomson optical depth {$\tau$} = 0.058{$\pm$}0.012 for the commonly adopted instantaneous reionization model. This confirms, with data solely from CMB anisotropies, the low value suggested by combining Planck 2015 results with other data sets, and also reduces the uncertainties. We reconstruct the history of the ionization fraction using either a symmetric or an asymmetric model for the transition between the neutral and ionized phases. To determine better constraints on the duration of the reionization process, we also make use of measurements of the amplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect using additional information from the high-resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope experiments. The average redshift at which reionization occurs is found to lie between z = 7.8 and 8.8, depending on the model of reionization adopted. Using kSZ constraints and a redshift-symmetric reionization model, we find an upper limit to the width of the reionization period of {$\increment$}z {$<$} 2.8. In all cases, we find that the Universe is ionized at less than the 10\% level at redshifts above z 10. This suggests that an early onset of reionization is strongly disfavoured by the Planck data. We show that this result also reduces the tension between CMB-based analyses and constraints from other astrophysical sources.},

Our fiducial (50 h-1 Mpc)3 volume is evolved to z = 0 with a quarter billion elements. The predicted galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) reproduces observations from z = 4 {$\rightarrow$} 0 to 1.2{$\sigma$} in cosmic variance, providing an unprecedented match to this key diagnostic. The cosmic star formation history and stellar mass growth show general agreement with data, with a strong archaeological downsizing trend such that dwarf galaxies form the majority of their stars after z {$\sim$} 1. We run 25 and 12.5 h-1 Mpc volumes to z = 2 with identical feedback prescriptions, the latter resolving all hydrogen-cooling haloes, and the three runs display fair resolution convergence. The specific star formation rates broadly agree with data at z = 0, but are underpredicted at z {$\sim$} 2 by a factor of 3, re-emphasizing a longstanding puzzle in galaxy evolution models. We compare runs using MFM and two flavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, and show that the GSMF is sensitive to hydrodynamics methodology at the {$\sim\times$}2 level, which is sub-dominant to choices for parametrizing feedback.},

  abstract = {Most of particle methods share the problem of high computational cost and in order to satisfy the demands of solvers, currently available hardware technologies must be fully exploited. Two complementary technologies are now accessible. On the one hand, CPUs which can be structured into a multi-node framework, allowing massive data exchanges through a high speed network. In this case, each node is usually comprised of several cores available to perform multithreaded computations. On the other hand, GPUs which are derived from the graphics computing technologies, able to perform highly multithreaded calculations with hundreds of independent threads connected together through a common shared memory. This paper is primarily dedicated to the distributed memory parallelization of particle methods, targeting several thousands of CPU cores. The experience gained clearly shows that parallelizing a particle-based code on moderate numbers of cores can easily lead to an acceptable scalability, whilst a scalable speedup on thousands of cores is much more difficult to obtain. The discussion revolves around speeding up particle methods as a whole, in a massive HPC context by making use of the MPI library. We focus on one particular particle method which is Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), one of the most widespread today in the literature as well as in engineering.},

  shorttitle = {{{SWIFT}}},
  abstract = {We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared/distributed-memory architectures. SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0 systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational approaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers of cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to decompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the data, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed across all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme, sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60\% parallel efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores 512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.},

  abstract = {We use cosmological simulations from the FIRE (Feedback In Realistic Environments) project to study the baryon cycle and galaxy mass assembly for central galaxies in the halo mass range Mhalo {$\sim$} 1010\textendash{}1013 M . By tracing cosmic inflows, galactic outflows, gas recycling and merger histories, we quantify the contribution of physically distinct sources of material to galaxy growth. We show that in situ star formation fuelled by fresh accretion dominates the early growth of galaxies of all masses, while the re-accretion of gas previously ejected in galactic winds often dominates the gas supply for a large portion of every galaxy's evolution. Externally processed material contributes increasingly to the growth of central galaxies at lower redshifts. This includes stars formed ex situ and gas delivered by mergers, as well as smooth intergalactic transfer of gas from other galaxies, an important but previously underappreciated growth mode. By z = 0, wind transfer, i.e. the exchange of gas between galaxies via winds, can dominate gas accretion on to {$\sim$}L{${_\ast}$} galaxies over fresh accretion and standard wind recycling. Galaxies of all masses re-accrete 50 per cent of the gas ejected in winds and recurrent recycling is common. The total mass deposited in the intergalactic medium per unit stellar mass formed increases in lower mass galaxies. Re-accretion of wind ejecta occurs over a broad range of time-scales, with median recycling times ({$\sim$}100\textendash{}350 Myr) shorter than previously found. Wind recycling typically occurs at the scale radius of the halo, independent of halo mass and redshift, suggesting a characteristic recycling zone around galaxies that scales with the size of the inner halo and the galaxy's stellar component.},

Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution.

We perform standard test calculations to verify the validity of the code; (i) emergent spectra from a static uniform sphere, (ii) emergent spectra from an expanding uniform sphere, and (iii) escape fraction from a dusty slab. Thereby, we demonstrate that our code solves the Ly{$\alpha$} radiative transfer with sufficient accuracy. We emphasize that SEURAT can treat the transfer of Ly{$\alpha$} photons even in highly complex systems that have significantly inhomogeneous density fields. The high adaptivity of SEURAT is desirable to solve the propagation of Ly{$\alpha$} photons in the interstellar medium of young star-forming galaxies like Ly{$\alpha$} emitters (LAEs). Thus, SEURAT provides a powerful tool to model the emergent spectra of Ly{$\alpha$} emission, which can be compared to the observations of LAEs.},

Only minor changes to a very small number of model parameters are required in the recalibration. We present predictions for the atomic hydrogen content (HI) of dark matter halos, which is a key input into the calculation of the HI intensity mapping signal expected from the large-scale structure of the Universe. We find that the HI mass - halo mass relation displays a clear break at the halo mass above which AGN heating suppresses gas cooling, {$\approx$} 3 \texttimes{} 1011h-1 M . Below this halo mass, the HI content of haloes is dominated by the central galaxy; above this mass it is the combined HI content of satellites that prevails. We find that the HI mass - halo mass relation changes little with redshift up to z = 3. The bias of HI sources shows a scale dependence that gets more pronounced with increasing redshift.},

DM halo shapes are determined using an iterative method based on the inertia tensor for a wide range of z = 0 masses (M200 = 1 \texttimes{} 1011 - 3 \texttimes{} 1014M ). Convergence tests shows that the local DM shape profiles are converged only for r {$>$} 9 , being the Plummer-equivalent softening length, larger than expected. Haloes from non-radiative simulations (i.e. neglecting radiative processes, star formation, and feedback) exhibit no alteration in shapes from their DM-only counterparts: thus moving-mesh hydrodynamics alone is insufficient to cause differences in DM shapes. With the full galaxy-physics implementation, condensation of baryons results in significantly rounder and more oblate haloes, with the median minor-to-major axis ratio s {$\equiv$} c/a {$\approx$} 0.7, almost invariant throughout the halo and across halo masses. This somewhat improves the agreement between simulation predictions and observational estimates of the Milky Way halo shape. Consistently, the velocity anisotropy of DM is also reduced in Illustris, across halo masses and radii. Within the inner halo (r = 0.15R200), both s and q (intermediate-to-major axis ratio) exhibit non-monotonicity with galaxy mass, peaking at m{${_\ast}$} {$\approx$} 1010.5-11M , which we find is due to the strong dependence of inner halo shape with galaxy formation efficiency. Baryons in Illustris affect the correlation of halo shape with halo properties, leading to a positive correlation of sphericity of MW-mass haloes with halo formation time and concentration, the latter being mildly more pronounced than in Illustris-Dark.},

Motivated by observations of radiative and jet mode feedback, ejection velocities are taken to be {$\sim$} 103 km s-1 at high Eddington ratios, increasing to 104 km s-1 at fEdd {$\sim{}<$} 0.01. Simba also includes an on-the-fly prescription for dust production and destruction. We tune the accretion efficiency tuned to 10\% to match the black hole mass (M{$\cdot$})\textendash{}stellar mass (M{${_\ast}$}) relation. Simba predictions agree with a range of galaxy observations comparably well or better than Mufasa and other modern simulations, including stellar mass functions from z = 0 - 6, H i and H2 fractions, stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relations, colour-mass diagrams, photometric sizes, and hot gas fractions in massive halos. There are hints that Simba may over-heat the diffuse intergalactic medium at z = 0, and may overproduce red satellites though not as severely as Mufasa. Modulo minor issues, the 2 \texttimes{} 10243-element Simba simulations with box sizes from 12.5 - 100h-1Mpc represent a state-of-the-art suite to examine a wide range of galaxy evolution phenomena, particularly related to galaxy\textendash{}black hole co-evolution and the circum-galactic medium of massive halos.},

The Pencil Code is particularly well suited to the study of magnetohydrodynamics in weakly compressible turbulence and the numerical investigation of dynamos because of its high-order advection and time evolution algorithms. However, the high-order algorithms and lack of Riemann solver to follow shocks make it less well suited to handling high Mach number shocks, such as those produced by supernovae (SNe). Here, we outline methods required to enable the code to efficiently and accurately model SNe, using parameters that allow stable simulation of SN-driven turbulence, in order to construct a physically realistic galactic dynamo model. These include the resolution of shocks with artificial viscosity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusion; the correction of the mass diffusion terms; and generalization of the Courant condition to include all source terms in the momentum and energy equations. We test our methods with the numerical solution of the 1D Riemann shock tube (Sod 1978), also extended to a 1D adiabatic shock with parameters and Mach number relevant to SN shock evolution, including shocks with radiative losses. We extend our test with the 3D numerical simulation of individual SN remnant evolution for a range of ambient gas densities typical of the interstellar medium and relate these to the analytical solutions of Sedov-Taylor (adiabatic) and the snowplough and Cioffi et al.

The model implements crucial aspects of stellar feedback including photoionization, radiation pressure, energy and momentum injection from stellar winds and from supernovae. We explore this model in high-resolution isolated simulations of Milky Way-like disc galaxies. Stellar feedback regulates star formation to the observed level and naturally captures the establishment of a Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. This result is achieved independent of the numerical mass and spatial resolution of the simulations. Gaseous outflows are generated with average mass loading factors of the order of unity. Strong outflow activity is correlated with peaks in the star formation history of the galaxy with evidence that most of the ejected gas eventually rains down onto the disc in a galactic fountain flow that sustains late-time star formation. Finally, the interstellar gas in the galaxy shows a distinct multiphase distribution with a coexistence of cold, warm and hot phases.},

Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several `urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the `neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the NDSPMHD SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

  abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity \& cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' \& numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, \& sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors \& numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

  abstract = {For simulations of fluid dynamics in astrophysics, physical viscosity and diffusion are typically neglected. However, in this high Reynolds number regime, real fluids become highly turbulent and turbulent processes mediate substantial transport of momentum and heat that is diffusive in nature. In the absence of models for these processes, code-dependent numerical effects dominate how diffusion operates and may lead to physically incorrect simulation results. We highlight the qualitative difference in these numerical effects for smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based Eulerian codes using two test problems: a buoyant gas bubble and gas in a galaxy cluster. Grid codes suffer from numerical diffusion in the absence of explicit terms, and small-scale diffusion of heat is completely absent in the Lagrangian SPH method. We find that SPH with heat diffusion added at a level similar to that expected from turbulence diffusion generates more physically appealing results. These results suggest, but do not confirm, that a flat entropy core is to be expected for gas in an idealized galaxy cluster (i.e. one without physics beyond that of a non-radiating gas). A goal of this work is thus to draw attention to the as yet unfulfilled need for models of turbulent diffusive processes in compressible gases in astrophysics.},

  volume = {425},
  issn = {00358711},
  abstract = {The numerical convergence of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can be severely restricted by random force errors induced by particle disorder, especially in shear flows, which are ubiquitous in astrophysics. The increase in the number NH of neighbours when switching to more extended smoothing kernels at fixed resolution (using an appropriate definition for the SPH resolution scale) is insufficient to combat these errors. Consequently, trading resolution for better convergence is necessary, but for traditional smoothing kernels this option is limited by the pairing (or clumping) instability. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of the Wendland functions as smoothing kernels and compare them with the traditional B-splines. Linear stability analysis in three dimensions and test simulations demonstrate that the Wendland kernels avoid the pairing instability for all NH, despite having vanishing derivative at the origin (disproving traditional ideas about the origin of this instability; instead, we uncover a relation with the kernel Fourier transform and give an explanation in terms of the SPH density estimator). The Wendland kernels are computationally more convenient than the higher-order B-splines, allowing large NH and hence better numerical convergence (note that computational costs rise sub-linear with NH). Our analysis also shows that at low NH the quartic spline kernel with NH \textasciitilde{}= 60 obtains much better convergence then the standard cubic spline.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {$<$} M{${_\ast}$}/M 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully\textendash{}Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass\textendash{}metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M{${_\ast}$} 109 M (M{${_\ast}$} 1010 M at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L = 50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation \textendash{} the EAGLE reference model \textendash{} by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass M (the `knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

This range of codes includes particle-based, moving and fixed mesh codes as well as both Eulerian and Lagrangian fluid schemes. The various GADGET implementations span classic and modern smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) schemes. The goal of this comparison is to assess the reliability of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of clusters in the simplest astrophysically relevant case, that in which the gas is assumed to be non-radiative. We compare images of the cluster at z = 0, global properties such as mass and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. The underlying gravitational framework can be aligned very accurately for all the codes allowing a detailed investigation of the differences that develop due to the various gas physics implementations employed. As expected, the mesh-based codes RAMSES, ART and AREPO form extended entropy cores in the gas with rising central gas temperatures. Those codes employing classic SPH schemes show falling entropy profiles all the way into the very centre with correspondingly rising density profiles and central temperature inversions. We show that methods with modern SPH schemes that allow entropy mixing span the range between these two extremes and the latest SPH variants produce gas entropy profiles that are essentially indistinguishable from those obtained with grid-based methods.},

  shorttitle = {{{SWIFT}}},
  abstract = {We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared/distributed-memory architectures. SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0 systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational approaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers of cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to decompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the data, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed across all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme, sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60\% parallel efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores 512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.},

We find IZw18 to be very metal-poor (Z = 1/20 Z ). IZw18 has a strong interstellar radiation field, with a large ionization parameter. We also use models of PopIII stars spectral energy distribution as a possible ionizing source for the He II {$\lambda$}4686 emission detected in the IZw18 NW component. We find that PopIII stars could provide a significant contribution to the line intensity. The upper limit to the PopIII star formation is 52 per cent of the total IZw18 SFR.},

Cholla models the Euler equations on a static mesh using state-of-the-art techniques, including the unsplit Corner Transport Upwind (CTU) algorithm, a variety of exact and approximate Riemann solvers, and multiple spatial reconstruction techniques including the piecewise parabolic method (PPM). Using GPUs, Cholla evolves the fluid properties of thousands of cells simultaneously and can update over ten million cells per GPU-second while using an exact Riemann solver and PPM reconstruction. Owing to the massively-parallel architecture of GPUs and the design of the Cholla code, astrophysical simulations with physically interesting grid resolutions ({$>$} 256\^3) can easily be computed on a single device. We use the Message Passing Interface library to extend calculations onto multiple devices and demonstrate nearly ideal scaling beyond 64 GPUs. A suite of test problems highlights the physical accuracy of our modeling and provides a useful comparison to other codes. We then use Cholla to simulate the interaction of a shock wave with a gas cloud in the interstellar medium, showing that the evolution of the cloud is highly dependent on its density structure. We reconcile the computed mixing time of a turbulent cloud with a realistic density distribution destroyed by a strong shock with the existing analytic theory for spherical cloud destruction by describing the system in terms of its median gas density.},

  shorttitle = {{{SWIFT}}},
  abstract = {Cosmological simulations require the use of a multiple time-stepping scheme. Without such a scheme, cosmological simulations would be impossible due to their high level of dynamic range; over eleven orders of magnitude in density. Such a large dynamic range leads to a range of over four orders of magnitude in time-step, which presents a significant load-balancing challenge. In this work, the extreme adaptivity that cosmological simulations present is tackled in three main ways through the use of the code SWIFT. First, an adaptive mesh is used to ensure that only the relevant particles are interacted in a given time-step. Second, task-based parallelism is used to ensure efficient load-balancing within a single node, using pthreads and SIMD vectorisation. Finally, a domain decomposition strategy is presented, using the graph domain decomposition library METIS, that bisects the work that must be performed by the simulation between nodes using MPI. These three strategies are shown to give SWIFT near-perfect weak-scaling characteristics, only losing 25\% performance when scaling from 1 to 4096 cores on a representative problem, whilst being more than 30x faster than the de-facto standard Gadget-2 code.},

  abstract = {Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a well-established approach to model fluids in astrophysical problems, thanks to its geometric flexibility and ability to automatically adjust the spatial resolution to the clumping of matter. However, a number of recent studies have emphasized inaccuracies of SPH in the treatment of fluid instabilities. The origin of these numerical problems can be traced back to spurious surface effects across contact discontinuities, and to SPH's inherent prevention of mixing at the particle level. We here investigate a new fluid particle model where the density estimate is carried out with the help of an auxiliary mesh constructed as the Voronoi tessellation of the simulation particles instead of an adaptive smoothing kernel. This Voronoi-based approach improves the ability of the scheme to represent sharp contact discontinuities. We show that this eliminates spurious surface tension effects present in SPH and that play a role in suppressing certain fluid instabilities. We find that the new `Voronoi Particle Hydrodynamics' (VPH) described here produces comparable results to SPH in shocks, and better ones in turbulent regimes of pure hydrodynamical simulations. We also discuss formulations of the artificial viscosity needed in this scheme and how judiciously chosen correction forces can be derived in order to maintain a high degree of particle order and hence a regular Voronoi mesh. This is especially helpful in simulating self-gravitating fluids with existing gravity solvers used for N-body simulations.},

  abstract = {We discuss differences in simulation results that arise between the use of either the thermal energy or the entropy as an independent variable in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). In this context, we derive a new version of SPH that, when appropriate, manifestly conserves both energy and entropy if smoothing lengths are allowed to adapt freely to the local mass resolution. To test various formulations of SPH, we consider point-like energy injection, as in certain models of supernova feedback, and find that powerful explosions are well represented by SPH even when the energy is deposited into a single particle, provided that the entropy equation is integrated. If the thermal energy is instead used as an independent variable, unphysical solutions can be obtained for this problem.},
